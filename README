RUN getModels.sh from command line to get the Pose-Estimation model
The model of pose-estimation was:
https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/models

The video is from Jeff Nippard - Build Bigger Shoulders With Perfect Training Technique (The Overhead Press)

For now you just have to run the OpenPoseVideo.py file with no arguments - because there is a lot videos that don't work with
this program

I tried implementing this project with OpenVINO but there were some environmental variables that weren't working so for now
i just did it without it, but in the future i will try to get it working with that

Most of the file i will redoit, because now I know a better way to do everything
